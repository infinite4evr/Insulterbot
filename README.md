InsulterBot generates insults programmatically.
If you ever feel annoyed by someone or something, this is the perfect solution to express your emotions in our current technological society.


Insults are generated in this format :

`<name> is) as <adjective> as <article target=adj1> <adjective min=1 max=3 id=adj1> <amount> of <adjective min=1 max=3> <animal> <animal_part>`



There are four text files in [`data`](https://github.com/azharxes/InsulterBot/tree/master/data) folder containing list of words which are being used for making insulting sentences

- [`adjective.txt`](https://github.com/azharxes/InsulterBot/blob/master/data/adjective.txt)
  * list of all the insulting adjectives.

- [`amount.txt`](https://github.com/azharxes/InsulterBot/blob/master/data/amount.txt)
  * list of all the insulting synonyms of amount 

- [`animal.txt`](https://github.com/azharxes/InsulterBot/blob/master/data/animal.txt)
  * list of all the animal names

- [`animal_part.txt`](https://github.com/azharxes/InsulterBot/blob/master/data/animal_part.txt)
  * list of all the animal parts
